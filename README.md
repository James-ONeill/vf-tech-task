# VF Resourcing Test Project

## Getting Started

In order for the project to function the API needs to be running. If for any reason it's not being served from
`https://localhost:4000` you can update the endpoint by changing the `baseURL` property in `/api/index.ts`.

First, install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
